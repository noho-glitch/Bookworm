#Bookworm
Bookworm is a online app that keeps track of books you've read, are reading, or would like to in the future.  You can keep track of your progress in a book, take notes on what you're reading as well as search for information on any book in the google books api to find something for future reading.
## Getting Started
Getting started is as easy as visiting our deployed site on heroku.  First time visitors are encouraged to register for an account [here](https://mysterious-meadow-98711.herokuapp.com/signup) to experience the full functionality of our website.  Although registering is not necessary and you can still search for new books to read, you just won't be able to save your progree and take notes on them.
